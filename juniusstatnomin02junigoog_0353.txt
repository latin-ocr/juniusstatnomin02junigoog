JUNIUS. 817

King might noi sttrihute to necessity, sud for which he would not he secure 01 ob-
uinng the spprohstion of his prostituted· Lords end Gemmeus.¹ If Lord Csmden
sdrnits thet the subsequent sanction 01 Perlinment was necessary to make the pro-

christion legal, why did he so obstinstely oppone the bill which wus soon ulier
' brought 'in l'or'indemaitying 011 those persons who hed ected under it? Ι1 that bill
'hed not been possed, l'sm· rendy to 010ἰο1οἰ0, in direct contradiction to Lord
Csmden's doctrine, tehen ss 8000010 state it, thet elitigioue exportet 01 corn, who
'ned suffered in hi's property in consequence 01 the prodemutiou, might heve laid his
'oetion eguisset the crustum-house offlcers, cndwould inlellihly have recmered deneges.
. 'mojory eoos reuse uem anu rr1, wuo am uy mma unguo, ne seen so
’ injured, 1 would ossuredly heve instituted 0 suit in Westmioster Hnll, on purpose to
try the question 01 right 1 would hsve done it upon 0 principle 01 definnce 01 the
’ pretended power 01 either or both Houses to make declaratione inconsistent with lew3
end Ι have no doubt that, with 00 Act 01 Perlisment on my side, 1 should lnce
' been too strong for them sll. This is the wey in which sn Englishmeu should spesk
sud uct3 end uot suffer dangerous precedente to he established, bemuue the circum
0100000 are suvourehle, or pslliating.
With regsrd to Lord Csmdm, the truth is, thst he inadvertently overshot him-
seli,¹ ns eppesrs plainly by thet unguurded mention 010 tyrenny 01 lorty dsys, which .
1 myself heard. Instead 01 asserting thet the proclsrnstion wes legul, he should
heresuid, “My Lords, l know the proclametion wss illegal3 hut 1 eduised it, be·
4 csuse it wss indispensahly necessary to save the kingdom from 1000ἰοος end l submit
myself to the justice and mercy 01 my country.”
Such lengucge es this would hare been menly, rational, aud consistent3 not

unfit for 0 lawyer, end every wey worthy 01 0 green men.
PHILO-JUNIUS.

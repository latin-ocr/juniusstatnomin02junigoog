nothing hut o heslthy, sanguine constitution. Under your core they usse thriven. Ι

unge ano ninoon' are sangoinis, when she some anu unetos sepem-1 sumu
no longer understood, and when mensures cre only felt in their remotest'cousoe
quenees, this hook will, 1 believe, be found to coutsin principles worthy to he trem-
mltted tc pcsterity. When you lesse tile unlmpoircd hereditsry t‘reehold. tc your
children, y'ou do hut hslf your duty. Both liberty snd property ste prccnrious,
unless the possessors hove sense uud'spin't enough to defend them. This is not thes

260 JUNIUS.

The only letter 1 ever addressed to the King was so nnkindly reoeived, that 1
believe 1 shall never presumo to trouble His Majesty in that way again. But my
Ἰ zesl for his nerviceis superior to negleot; ond, like Mr. Wilkes's patriotism, thrives
by persecution. - Yet His MaJesty is muohaddicted to uselul reading3 and, rr1 am
notill informed, has honoured the Publio Advertiser with particular attention. Ihave
endeavoured, therefore, and not without success, (as perhaps you may remember),
to'lurnislr it¹ with such interesting ond edisying intelligenoe, as probably would not

resch him through any other channel. The services you have done the nation- ’

your integrity in office, and signal fidelity to your approved good master, hove been
· rdthfuuy recorded. Nor hove his own virtues been entirely neglected. These .
letters, r'ny Lord, are read in other countries and in other languages; and 1- think'
Imoy affirm vetanus vanis„ tharne gmon character or we sest osrances on,
this time not only perfootly known to his subjecte, but tolerably well understood by
the 'rest of Europe. In this respect alone 1 have the adventage of Mr. Whitehead.
His plna, I think, is too norrow. He seems to mafanum his verses for the sole
use of the hero who‘is supposed to be the subject of them, and, that his meaning
may nothe exported in foreign bottoms, sets sll translations at dedanoe.

Your Grsoe's reoppointment to a seat in tlre cabinet wss announced to the
publio by the ominous return of Lord Rute to this country. When that noxious
planet approaches England, he never fails to bring plague sntl pestilence along with
him. The King already feels the malignant effect ol' your influence over his oouncils.
,Your former administration made Mr. Wilkes an Alderman of London, and repre·
anutive os Middlesert. Your next appearance in office is marked yvith his election
to the Shrieralty. In whatever measure you are concerned, you are not only dis-
-sppoinrsd ot' moraes, bur always contrive to make the Government of the hest of

Prinoes

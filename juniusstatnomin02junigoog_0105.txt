SIR, · ⁴ ’ July 19, 1769.

A great deal of useless argument might have been

saved in the political contest which has ariscn from the expulsion of Mr. Wilkes, and Ι
thesubseqdent appointmentof Mr. Luttrell, if the question hed been once stated with
precision, to the satisfaction of each party, and clearly understood by them both.
¹But in this, as in almost every other disputo, it usually happens that much time is Ι
lost in referring to a multitude of cases and precedents which prove nothing to the
purpose3 or in maintaining propositione which are either. not disputed, or whether
they he admitted or denied, are entirely indifferent as to the matter in debate; until
, at last the mind, perplexed and consounded with the endless subtilties ol' controversy,
loses sight of the‘main question, and never arrives at truth. Both parties iu the
dispute are apt enoughtopractise these dishonest artifices. The man, whoisconscious
os the neakness of his cause, is interested in concealing it; and, on the other side, it
is not uncommon to see a good cause mangled by advocates who do not know the real
strength of it ’ ¹
¹ = 1 should he glad to know, for instance, to what purpose, in the present case,
so many precedents have been produced to prove thot the House of Commons
have a right·to expel one of their own members; that it belongs to them to jndge
os the salidity of electious3 or that‘ tho law of 'parliament is part ot* thelaw of the

N 2 land.

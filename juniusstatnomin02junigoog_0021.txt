With regard to strictures upon the characters of men in office, and the mes·⁴
sures of Gorerpment, the csse iss little different. Aconsiderable lstitnde must be
sllowed in the discussion of public affairs, or the liberty of the prese will beot no ⁸

be checked end resisted by every legal means, so a constent examinatior into the
chaceurs and conduct οἰ ministers end magistrates should be equslly pmmoted snd
encouraged. They, who conceive thet our newspspers ,are no restraint upon bed
men, or impediment tothe execution of bad mensures, know nothing os this country.

In that state of abandoned servility ond pmstitetion, to which the undue influence ol* ,

the crown has reduced the other branches of the legislatore, our ministers and magi.
strates heve in reality little punishment to seer, and few difficulties to eontend with,
beyond the censure of the press, and the spirit of resistenee which it excites among
the people. While this censoriel power is maintained, to spesk in the words of e
most ingenious foreigner, both minister ond megi-strete is compellcd, in almost ‘every
instance, to chuse between his duty and his mputstion. A dilemma of this kind per·
petually before him, will not indeed work s mirsele upon his beart, but it will assu.

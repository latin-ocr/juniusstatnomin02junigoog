unlimited imprisonnsent. Cutting off eens end nosos might still be inflicted by e re-
solute judge3 but 1 will be condid enough to suppose, tlset penelties, so apparently
shoeking to¹ humenity, would not be hezerded in 'these times. In cll other
criminel prosecutions, the jury decides upon the fort und the crime in one word;

end the Court pronounces e certain sentence, which is the sentence ot the lew,
not ol the judge. 1f Lond Mensfield's doctrine he received, the jury must either
find o verdiot of eequittal, contrary to evidence, (which, Icen conceive, might be·
' done by very conscientious rnen, rather then trust e follow-creature to Lord Mons-

field's mercy), or they must leave to the Court two offiees, never hut in this instem
united, of finding guilty, end ewerding punishment

But, reys this honest Lord Chios Justioe, ‘⁴ Ifthepeper be not crimind, the de-
fendent? (though found guilty by his Peers), ‘⁴ is in no danger, ior he moy move the
Court in meet oijudgrnent” True, my good Lord; hut who is to determine upon the
motioni lv not the ,Court still to decide, whether judgment shall be entered up or
not? end is not the defendant this wey ee effeetuuhy deprived of judgment by his
Peers, uishewerehiedineCorwtoicivillnw, orinthechnmbers of the inqrdsi-
tion? It is you, my Lord, who then try the crime, not the jury. As to the probeble
effect oi the motion in orreet of judgment, I shall only ohserve, thet no reasonable
mon would be so eeger to possess himseli‘ol' the invidious power of indicting punish·
ment, is he were not predetermined to mele use of it.

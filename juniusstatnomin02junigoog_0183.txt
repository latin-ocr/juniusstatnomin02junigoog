LETTER XXXII.

To THE PRINTER OF ΤῌΕ PUBLIC ADVERTISER.

-Φ-

SIR, November 15, 1769.

1 admit the elsim of s gentlemsn who publishes
in the Gazetteer under the nume os Modestus. He hss some right to expect sn
snswer from me; though, 1 think, not so much from the merit or importante of his
objections, ss from my own voluntsry engagement 1 hod s resson for not tsking
notice of him sooner, which, ss he is s condid pemon, l believe he will think unffi..
cient. In my first letter, 1 took t'or granted, from the time which hsd elspscd, that
there uss no intention to censure, nor even ὠ try, the pensons concemed in the

reseue οἲ Genersl Gsnssl3 but Modestus having since either sllirmed, or strongly

insinusted‚ that the offenders might still he brought to s legul trial, any attempt ω .

prejudge the cause, or to prejudice the minds os s jury ur s court-mortim, would be
highly improgler. ·

A mon more hostile to the Ministry thsn 1 sm, would not so osten remind
¹ them os their duty. If the Duke ol Grslton will not pesform the duty of his station,
why'is hs Minister? Iwill not descend to s scurrilous altereation with sny msn3 but

, ’ this is s subject too important to be possed over with silent indifference lt the gen.

tlemen whose conduct is in question, ure not bsuught to s trinl, the Duke of Grstton

shsll henr from me again.

The motives on which 1 sm supposed to have tsken up this oense, sse of little ο

Ζ inportunos

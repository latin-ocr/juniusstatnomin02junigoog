To JUNIUS.

⁴.-

sm, February 27, 1769.

l Ihsve every short mersor Junius's importent
question. 1 do not either tshe nn ooth, ordeolum upon honour, thot 1 hove no pineo
of profit, civil or military, when 1 receive the holf÷pey os nn Irish Colonei. My
most grscious Sovereign gives it me ns n pension3 he wne plessed to think 1 deserved
it The onnuity of two hundred ponnds 1rinh, ond the equivalent for the heis-psy,
together, produce no more than three hundred ond eighty munds per annum, clear
of sees nnd perquisites of office. Α Ι reeeive one hundred ond sixtyeeven pounds tium
my govemment of anmouth: total, five hundred und fortyeeven pounds per
mnum. My conscienoe ie much et ense in these perticulam my friends need
not blush for me.

J unius makes much und frequentare oi interrogations: they ore orms thet moy
he easily turned against himself. 1 oould, hy mulioious interrogation, disturh the
peoee of the most virtuous men in the kingdom. Ioould tske the deoslogue, end
say to one men-Did you never stenl? To the next-Did you never oommit murder?
And to J uniushimselt', whois putting nhy life end conduct to the rech—Did you nem .
beer sulse witness against thy neighbour? Junius must easily see thot, unless he

sffinns to the oontrnry in his reni nume, some people, who moy be ns ignorent of
him as 1 am, efflue apt so snpetffimofuv'ngneeserantoesmmuenud:
therefore let J unius ask no more questions. You bite agunt e file: oense, viper!

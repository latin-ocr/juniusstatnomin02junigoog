JUNIUS. Ι ³55

1 will nat say that every minute part of it is absolutely invulnerable. 1 am too wall
saquainted with the practice oi a certain cnurt, directed by your example as it is
governad by your authority, to think thare ever yet was an argument, however
conformable to law and masan, in which a cunning, quibbling attorney might nat
dimovet aflaw. But taking the whole of it together, l affirm that it constitutes a
mass of denominatim, than which nothing more complete o'r satisfactory can be
offered to the human mind. How an evasive, indireot reply will stand with your
rapamtion, or how iar it will answer, in point oi defende, at the bar of the Hense of '
Lords, iswortb'your mnsiderttion. 1f, aster all· that has been said, it should still
be maintained that the court of liing’s Benoh in bailing selom, ase attempted from Ι
all legal nsles wbatsoarer, and that the J ud'ge has no direetm tn pursue but his pri-
vata affectione, armare unquentionshle will and plemurs, it will follow plainly, that
the ἀίεῐὶιιοὶίοιι between bailabla and not baiiabls, uniformly expressed by the legisla-
ture, canent through sil our law-books, and admitted by all our great lawyers with- r
'out exception, is, iu one sense, a nugatory, in another, a pernicious distinction. ‘lt
is nugatory‚ as it mpposes a diffarenoe in the bailable quality oi offences, when, in
effect, the distinction refers only to the rank oi tha magistrate. lt is pamiaious, aa
it implies a rula ol law which yet the Judge is not bound to pay the least regard tu;
and impressas an ima sapen the minda of the people that the Judge is wiser aud
greater than the law.
lt remmus only to apply the law, thus stated, to the fact in question. By an

'authentia copy of the atittisaas, it appears that John Eyre was committed for felony,

· plainly and spsoially exprffled in' tha warrant ot' comminuent. He was charged
before Alderman Haliiax, hythe nath ot' Thomas Ih'elding, William llolder, William

Payne, and William Nash, ror felonionsly stesling eleven quires of waiting papan,

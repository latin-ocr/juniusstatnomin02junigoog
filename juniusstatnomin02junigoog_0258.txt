rious injustioc to that Governor. Asa salvo ior his own reputation, he hca besu
advised to traduce the characteres a braveoffioer, and to treat him as a common
rohher, when he knew with certainty that Mr. Bucarolli had acted in ohedienoc to
his orders, and had done uo more thau his duty. Thus it happens in privcte use,
with a man who has no spirit nor sense os honour. One of hia uhrah orders ascr-

sant to striks him: instead of saturning the hlow to the muster, hia courage isoon·
tented with throwing an aspersion, equally false aud public, upon the character of

the esmant.

This short recapitulation was neoeoearyto introduce the consideration oina Ma- ι
jesty's speech of the lSth of November, 17⁷0, and the subsequent measures of Gorern·
ment. The excessirecaution with. which⁴ the speech was drawn up, had impresacd
upon me an early convictiou thatuo aerium resentmeut was thought of, aud that-use
conclusion of the business, whenevsr it happened, must in some degrne ha dishonoor-
sble to Englaud. There appears through the whole speech agon-d and min
the choice of expression, which shew how carefui the Ministry were, not to catharrus
theirt'uture projectshy anyfirm or spiriteddeclsratioufrom the throne. When allhopes
os peace are lost, HisMajesty telishis Parliameut that he is preparing', not forharhamus

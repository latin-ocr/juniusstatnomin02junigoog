he obtained for the King. If the premiaea were admitted, Ι should deny the
conclusion. Itis not turre, thet the temper of thetimea hes ingeneret en nndue
intluence over the conduct ofjuries. On the contrary, many signal instances rnay hc
produced of verdicts returned for the King‚ when the inclinatione of the peopie led
strongly to en umdistinguished opposition to Government. Witness the cases of
Mc. Wilkes and Mr. Mmon. Iu the lete prosecutione of the printem oi my eddress

Mansfield, conscious thet the peper in question contained no treosonahle or libellons
matter, end thet the severest perts os it, however pninfnl to the King, or offensive
to his servante were strictly true, would fain heve restricted the jury to the finding
of special secte, which, es to guilty or not vdit, were merelyindifferent. This par.

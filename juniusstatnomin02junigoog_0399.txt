you the fatal purposes to'which it has been, and may he applied. if we are sincere in

the political creed we profess, there are many things which we ought to offinn cannot
bc done by King, Lol-ds, and commone. Among these I reckon tha disfrsochising

ol’ boroughs with a general riew of improvement. 1 consider it as equivalent to
rohhing the parties concerned of their freehold, of their birthright. 1 say, thet

what, apparently and polpohly, they had no power to do; but they did more then

people in general were errare ol; they, in effect, disfrenchised the whole kingdom
for four years.

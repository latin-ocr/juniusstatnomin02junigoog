To SIR WILLIAM DBAPER, mi

-Φ-

sm, September es, 1⁷69.

Arrun so long an interval, Ι did not expect to

'see the debete revived between us. My answcr to your last letter shall bo shorte

l‘or 1 write to you with reluctance, and 1 hope we shall now conclude our corre·
, spondence t'or ever.

Hod you been originally, and without provocation‚ attached by an anonymous

writer, you would have some right to demand his name. But in this cause you arc

avolanteer. You engaged in it with the unpremeditated gallanhy ot* asoldier. ·

You were content to set your name in opposition to a man who would probably
'continue in concealment. You understood the terms upon which we were to cor·
“ respond, and gare at least a tacit assent to them. Alter voluntan‘ly attacking me
under the character os J unius, what possible sight have you to know me under any
other? Will you forgive me ifI insinuate to y’ou, that you foresaw some honour in
the apparent spirit of coming forward in person, and-that you were not quite indii-

‘ferent to the' display of your literary qualifications? ’ -
⁴ · You cannot but know that the republicetion of my' letters was no more than
μ Τ 2 a catch-penny

intereat His palernal tendemess should remind him how many hostages he hes
given to society. The ties ol' nature come powert‘ully in aid ot* oaths and protest-

tegrity and justice-or what is the vain reputation ot* firmness, aven if the scheme of
the government were uniform and consistent, compared with the heartfelt affectione
of the people‚ with the happiness and security ot* the Royal Family, cr even with the
gratetirl acclamations of the populace? Whatevar style of contempt may be adopted.

speech is rude, but intelligible; their gestures fietne, hut t'ull of explanation. Pe..
plexed by sophistries‚ their honest eloquence rises into action. Their ‘first appeal
was to the integr-ily of their representativea3 the amend, to the King's justice; the ¹
last argument of the people‚ whenever they have meonrse to it, will carry more per-
heps than persuasion to Parliament, or supplicetion to the 'ihrone.. ·

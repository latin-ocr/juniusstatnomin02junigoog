· SIR,
It is the missortune oi your life, end originally

the came of every repronch and distress which has attended your governmeut, that
you should never hare been ecquaiuted with the language of truth, until you heard

it in the complaints os your people. It is not, however, too late to correct the error
of your education. We ere still inclined to multe nn indulgent allowonce sor the

pernicious lessons you received in your youth, end tn form the most sanguine hopes

from the natural benevolente of your disposition⁸. We are sar from thinking you

⁸ The plan oi tutelrge and iuture dominion orer the heir appetent, laid many years ago at Carietott
House, between the Princess Dowager and her farourite, the Ean ot Bute, was os gross and palpeble as that
which was concerted between Anne oi Austris and cardinal Mazarine, to gosem Louis the Fourteentb, and
in effect to prolong his minority until the end oi their lires. That Prisce had strong natural parts, and uted
frequently to blush sorbis own ignorante and went ol' education, which hed been wilioliy neglected by hie
mother and bet minion. A little experiente, however, soon shewed him how ehameiuily he hnd been treated,
end ior what iniamous purpose· he had been kept in ignorante. Our greatEdword, too, at enecrly period, had
sense enough to understand the nature or tlte connection between his abandoned mother and the detested
Monimer. Eut since that time, burnan nature, we may observo, is greutiy altered tor the better. Dowagen
may herberte, und minione may be honest. When it was proposed to settle the prerent King'e homehold,
at Prinne oi wales, it isweli known that the Earl of bute was forced into it, in direct contudietion to the-
late lling's inclination. 'lhat was the salient point from which nii the micohiefs aud dbgracer oi the praeut
reign took lite and motion. From that moment bord Bute neret suffered the Prinne oi Waler to be an in-

stant out olbis sight. We need not look further.

letter, nry Lord, is addressed not so much to you, as to the public. Learned as you

are, and quiclr in apprehension, few arguments are necessary to sstisfy you that you
have done that which by law you were uot warranted to do. Your conscience already
tells you that you bave sinued against knowledge, and that whatever desence you
make, contradicta yo‘ur own intercal conviction. Eut other men are willing enough
to' take the'law upon trust. ¹ They rely, upon ydus authority, because they are too
indoleat to search ior informetibn; or, conceiving that there'is som'e mysbery in the
'lawa os their conouy which lawyers are only qualibed to explain, they distrust their'
judgmeat, and voluntarily renouare tbe'right of thinking tor themselves. With ab
the evidence 'of history before them, from 'Tresilisir to Jefferies, from Jefferies to
Mansfield, they will not believe it possible ¹that aleemed Judge cau act in direct

ehuoeteristic of this age. Yet some men are big'otted in politica, who are infidela ib

to bail in cases not bellabis by a J urtice of Peaoe, not replerisable by the common
wrb, or ex officio by tbe Sberiff. 1 well know the practice of the Coun, and by what
legal rules it ought to be directed. Butler from meaning tn susten or diminisb the
force os those terma I bave made use of, 1 now go beyond them, aud affirm, ι
1. Tbot tho superior power ot* bailing for felony, claimed by the Court ot
King's Benclu is founded upon the opinion of lawyers, and tbe practice of the Conni
that the assent of the legislatore to this power is merely 'semiue aad that it is not
supported by any positive prorision in any statute whsuoever, If it be, produce the
statute.

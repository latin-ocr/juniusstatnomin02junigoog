ΜΥ Lonn,

1 sonu with plessure lrom that barren waste, in
which no sslutnry plant tskes root, no verdure quickens, to achmeter fertile, es
1 willingly believe, in every great end good qualification. Icsll on you, in the neme
of the English oetion, to stand forth in defenee of the lewe ol your country, end to
exest, in the osuse of truth end justice, those grest ebilities with which you were
enmono for the henefit of mankind. Το aseertein the facts set forth in the pre-
ceding pepon, it moy be necessary to oell the persons mentioned in the motinus to the
ber of the House os Lords. Iso motion forthst purpose-should berejeetetl‚ we
shsll know whst to think of Lonl Monsfielrl's innocense. The legul argument is
submitted to your Lordship’s judgment. Alter the noble stsnd you mede against
Lonl Msnsfielcl upon the question of libel, we did expect thet you would not beve
suffered thet mstter to heve remsioed undetermined. But it was said thet Lord Chiei
Justice ¹Wilrnot hed been prersiled upon to vouch lor sn opinion ol' the lete J udge
Yetes, which wss supposed to mehe against γους end we admit of the excuse. When
such dwoebhle erte ere employed to prejudge e question οἰ right, it might have been
imprudent et thet time to hove brought it to e decision. In the present instsnee you
will heve nosuch opposition to oontend with. It' there be sJudge, or s lswyer of any

note in westminster nul, who sholl be during enough to affirm that, socordiogtb the
true intendment of the lsws of Englend, sidon, tsken with the maner, in flagrante

nouo, isbnilsble, or thst the diseretion of sn English Judge iemerely arbium,

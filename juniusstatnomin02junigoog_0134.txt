SIR, August 22, 1769.

1 must heg of you to print a lew linea, in
explanation of some passages in my last letter, which 1 see have been misun-
derstood. Ι

1. When 1 said thet the House of Commons never meant to found ΜΓ. Wol-

pole's incapacity on hia expulsion only, Imeant no more than to deny the general . Ι

’ proposition, that expulsioni alone creatas the incapacity. Is there be any thingam-
higuous in the expression, 1 beg leave to explain it hy saying that, in my opinion,
expulsion neither creater, nor in any part oontnhutes to create, the incapaoity in
question.

2. 1 carefully avoided entering into the merite of Mr. Walpole's case. 1 did
not enquire whether the House oi Commons acted justly, or whether they troly

declared the law of Parliament. My remarks went only to their* apparent meaning
· and intention, as it stands declared in their own resolution.

3. Inevermeentto affirm that a commitment to the Tower created a dis·
qualification. On the contrary, 1 considered that idea as an abnndity‚ into which
the Ministry must meritably fell, if they ressoned right upon their own principles '

The case of ΜΓ. Wollaston speaks for itself. The Ministryessert thet expul-
sion alone creatas on absolute, complete incapacity to be re-eleoted to rit in the same

. Parliament.

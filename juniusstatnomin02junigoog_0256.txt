Ι1 we recollect in what manner the King's friends ·
have been constantly employed, we shall hare no reason to he 0010110οἀ 01 any oon·
dition 01 diagrace 10 which the once respected neme 01 Engliahmen may he degmded.

· His Majesty has no cares, but such aa concern the laws end constitution 01 this
country. 1n his royal breast there is no 000001011100 resentment, 00 plene for hos·
1110 sentimenta against the natural enemies 01 his crown. The system 01 government
is uniform; violence and oppression ethome can only be supported by treachery end ·
submissior abroad. When the civil rights 01 the 000010 ane deringly invaded 00 000
side, what hove we to expect but thot their politicel rights should be deserted and
betrayed, in the seme proportion,¹ on the other? The plan 01 domestic policy which
hes been invariably pursued from the moment 01 his present Majesty's accession,
engrosses all the attention 01 his servants. They know that the security 01 their

· places depende upon their maintaining, 01 eny 1100001, the secret system 01 the cloaet.
A foreign 001· might embarress, an uniavonrable event might ruin the Minister, and
defeat the deep-laid scheme 01 policy to which he and hia associates owe their · em·
ployments. Rather than suffer the execution 01 that scheme 10 be delayod 0010100-
rupted, the King hes been advised to make apublic surrender, 0 solemn sacrifice,
in the 1000 01011 Europe, 001 only 0111ιο 10100010 01 hia subjecta, but 01 his own personat

the newspspers. But since lbere attncked your character, nnd you complaiu οι
injustice, lthink you bare some right to eu explanation. Yon ‹lefy me ιο prore
that you ever solicited n rote, or wrote a word in support of the ministerial
Alderrnen. Sir, idid never suspect you of such gross tolly. lt would hareheen
impossible t'or Mr. Horue ιο heve solicited votes, nnd very difficolt to hare written ⁸
t'or the nevspcpers in defenoe of thet ceuse, without being detected, and brought to

shame. Neitber do l pretend to eny intelligence concerning you, or ιο know more
‘ol' your conduct then you youtsell' hove thought proper to communicate to tbe
public. Itis t‘rom your own lettersI conclude that you bare sold yoruuelt' to the

Ministry; or, if that charge be too serere, and supposing it possible ιο be deceired

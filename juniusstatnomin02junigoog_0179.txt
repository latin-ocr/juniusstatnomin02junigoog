SIR, November 14, 1769.
The variety of remarks which have been made
upou the last letter of J unius, and my own opinion of the writer, rrho, whatever
may be his lauhs, is certainly not a weak man, have induced me to examine
with some attention the subject of that letter. I could not persuade myself that,
⁶ while he had plenty of important materiale, he would have taken up slight or

trifling occasion to attach the minislry; much less could l conceive that it was

his intention to ruin the officere concerned in the reseue of General Gansel, or to
injure the General himself. These are little objecta, and canno way contributa to

Without considering the ornameuted style he has adopted, I determiued to look further
into the matter, before 1 decided upon the menits of hia letter. The first step I
took, was to enquire into the truth of the facts; for if these were either false or
misrepresented‚ the most artful exertion of his understanding in reasoning upon
them, would only be a disgrace to him. Now, Sir, 1 hare sound every mcum-
sterce stated by sanius, to beliterally true. General Gausel persuaded the hailill's
to conduct him to the Parada, and certainly solicitad a Corporal and other soldiem
to assist him in making his escape. Captaiu Dodd did certainly apply to Captain
Garth for the assislauoe of his guard. Captain Garth declined appearing himself,

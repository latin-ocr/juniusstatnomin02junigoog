that if s papst, supposed to be s hbel upon Govesnment, be so obscnnely worded,
that twelve common men osnnot possibly sse the seditione meaning nod tendeucy

Upon the whole mnttnr it sppenns, to my understsnding, clear beyond e

syerdiet of soquittal not wsnronted by the evidence, it will be owing to the false aod

Some opinion moy now¹ be expected frum me, upon s point of equnl delicncy
to the writer, ond hnznrd to the printer. When the character os the chief megi·
strete is in question, more must be understood then moysnlcly be expressed. 1f it be
really e pert οἰ our constitution, end not a mene ιὶίιιοοι ot' the low, thet the Κίος ceu

vour to corrupt¹ their moral principles, l would not scruple to declare to him, “ Sir,
